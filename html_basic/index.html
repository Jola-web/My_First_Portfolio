    <h1>Welcome to My First Webpage</h1>

    <h2>About This Page</h2>
    <p>This is my first ever webpage using HTML. I'm building it as part of the ALX program.</p>

    <h3>What You'll Find Here</h3>
    <p>There are headings, paragraphs, and even an image below! I'm learning how to structure a web page using HTML.</p>

    <p>I'm excited about web development and the opportunity to showcase what I'm learning.</p>

    <p>This is just the beginning of a long journey into coding and development.</p>
